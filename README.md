1. Generate a Voiceprint
A voiceprint is a unique representation of a person's voice, typically extracted using feature extraction techniques from a voice sample.
2. Encrypt the Voiceprint with FHE
3. Store the Encrypted Voiceprint in the Blockchain
4. Integrate with 1inch or Worldcoin ID



###
Use a pyAudio and librosa to extract features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from the voice sample.

Use the Voiceprint for Authentication:
1:Detect if the specified text is spoken in speech 2:Detect if it is the same person's voiceprint
Storing and Comparing Voiceprints
